_Embracing more remote overtones of the harmonic series_. The hunter-gatherer relies on their `sensory` to decide when to go hunting and gathering. It's all about hunger. But if `memory` of harships serves you right, as population growth and competition for niches and land emerge, then sowing seed and bringing in the shieves becomes a communal obligation. Later the slave will toil to produce a surplus for the conquering tribe and this will encode an unforgettable `emotional` imprint; history will never be the same again. Soon, the very essence of farming will be codified and made programmable so that autonomous and `intelligent` machines and an industrial revolution take over these ancient processes. This is _The Matrix_. With humans being displaced with from manual labor, with their alientation from their species essence, there emerges a new use for them: as a source of critical energy in a world that hungers for "compute". This is the `capital` of the _openAI_ generation. And so the stage is set for the _School of Resentment_ to wax lyrical about the ascendency of AI and its `deployment` to every corner of the world, in every imaginable industry, and the ethics of it all. This is the world of 2024 and beyond.
